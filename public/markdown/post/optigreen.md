🌱 OPTI Green — Smarter AI, Greener Compute

Description:
OPTI Green is an intelligent dashboard that analyzes and optimizes LLM (Large Language Model) token usage to reduce API costs and compute energy consumption. It helps developers and organizations make AI usage more efficient, sustainable, and transparent — one token at a time.

🚀 Key Features

🔍 Real-Time Token Analyzer: Instantly estimates token count, cost, and energy impact for any AI prompt.

⚙️ Prompt Optimization: Automatically rewrites prompts to achieve the same output with fewer tokens.

📊 Model Comparison: Compare efficiency between GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and other models.

♻️ Green Metrics Dashboard: Visualizes carbon and cost savings over time.

💾 Context-Aware Token Estimation: Tracks usage by project, prompt, and model version.

🧠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite

Styling: TailwindCSS + React Icons

State Management: React Context API

Utilities: Custom Token Estimation + LLM Cost Simulation

Visualization: Recharts (for cost, token, and energy graphs)

🌍 Impact

By improving LLM token efficiency, OPTI Green enables:

Up to 40–70% reduction in prompt token consumption

Lower API bills for developers and startups

Reduced compute energy usage, contributing to greener AI systems

💼 Use Cases

AI Developers optimizing prompts

Startups managing API expenses

Enterprises tracking AI carbon footprint

Researchers analyzing prompt efficiency

🧩 Hackathon Context

Originally built for a Hackathon challenge to design sustainable AI tools, OPTI Green merges AI efficiency, energy awareness, and cost transparency in a single interface.
